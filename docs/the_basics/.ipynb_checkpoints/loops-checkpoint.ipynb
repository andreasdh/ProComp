    "A loop is a programming structure that repeats a code, either a certain number of times or until a criterion is reached.\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops allow us to take advantage of the computer's ability to quickly perform operations multiple times. Using loops, for example, the computer can find the number 10 531 in the Fibonacci sequence in less than one second, or it can calculate the solution to an analytically insoluble equation by repeating the same operation 10000 times. Loops are the most important and useful programming structure we have.\n",

    "This is called a *for-loop*, which is a counting-loop that iterates (goes through) numbers in an interval. The command *range(1000)* means that we create a variable that will go through an interval specified in parentheses. If we write range(5), the interval becomes [0, 1, 2, 3, 4], that is, from 0 to - but not including - 5. If we write range(2,6), the interval becomes [2, 3, 4, 5]. If we add another argument to the range function, we can specify the step: range(2,11,2) gives the numbers [2,4,6,8,10]. Each time the loop code is repeated, the variable *i*, which we call a \"count variable\", gets the next value in the interval. The loop is thus repeated five times in the code above. The indented code in the loop is repeated each time the loop runs.\n",

The  variable the_sum becomes equal to the previous the_sum + even_number: the_sum = the_sum + even_number = 0 + 2 = 2. The next time the loop runs, i = 1.
