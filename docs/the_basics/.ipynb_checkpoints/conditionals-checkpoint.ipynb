    "# Conditionals and logic\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditionals are central in programming, but also central in everyday life. Let's start simply with ticket prices on the bus. If the age is under 18, the price will be 3 dollars, and half the price of an adult ticket. We can describe this with the following pseudocode:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} text\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    price = 3\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    price = 62\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python this program will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```{code-block} Python\n",
    "if age < 18:\n",
    "    price = 3\n",
    "else:\n",
    "    price = 62\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we are going to look at examples where conditionals can be used to illustrate concepts in your discipline. We are using simple examples here, but it can of course be applied to more complex problems. You can choose the tab with your discipline.\n",

    "A good way to work with logic and programming is to concentrate on how a problem can be solved, rather than emphasizing the syntax (that is, how we write the code).\n",
    "\n",
    "To structure a program code, you may want to use a flow chart. A flow chart provides both information about the mathematical premises and an overview of the structure of the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "An example is the following flow chart, which shows what possible outcomes we can have when solving a quadratic equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "ADD FLOWCHART HERE\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, code belonging to a condition is indented. We can therefore say that each individual condition in the flow chart represents one indent.\n",
    "\n",
    "This logic in programs can be explored using _programming puzzles_.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a programming puzzle, all the lines of code are given as \"puzzle pieces\". The task is to sort these code parts in the correct order and with the correct structure. Such puzzles are also called \"Parsons problems\". The puzzles can be generated digitally from ![the following webpage](http://parsons.problemsolving.io/).\n",
    "\n",
    "First solve ![this puzzle about ticket prices](http://parsons.problemsolving.io/puzzle/980be2ba272446aebbb1a3eaeb1f1bea). Then use the flow chart above to solve ![this programming puzzle](http://parsons.problemsolving.io/puzzle/11a1f9881efa4f1796c7fe11efbaec3a). The program will find out how many solutions we have given the coefficients a, b and c in a quadratic equation.\n",
