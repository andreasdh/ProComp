    "Variables are well known in mathematics. When we write _a_ = 2, _a_ is the variable name and 2 is the assigned value. This is also the case in programming; a variable is a quantity that can store a value in a program. The variable can be changed throughout the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "Variables are especially useful when we need to use the same value multiple times, or when we need to update a value during the program. A simple example is if we want to find ten numbers in a certain series of numbers. We can describe this as follows with a pseudocode:"
