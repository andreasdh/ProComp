# Welcome to ProComp

You may be more or less familiar with programming. I may also sound intuitive what scientific programming is. But scientific programming is a lot more than doing science with programming. It is a way of thinking, a way of learning and a way of teaching. In these courses you will take a close look at how you can implement programming in your teaching.

These courses show you have to use programming and computational thinking in mathematics and science in higher education.
